# this is a qb-clothing modified to work with my qb-charcreator

## Why you need this to work?
- because qb-clothing original work with face features division the number int to 10 that is the minimum is 0 and max is 30 he divide to 10 and received 1.0, 1.1
 and so on my qb-charcreator no, the options is -1.0 at 1.0 look like say in description of FiveM native [face features native](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x71A5C1DBA060049E)
